# Publishes images to Docker Hub

# We expect this repo to one day contain multiple useful Coder images, but currently it
# only has one option, 'base'. To keep tag names coherent, we're providing three ways to
# reference variants:
#   * by release number and variant name (e.g. harrisonai/coder-dev:0.1.0-base),
#   * by variant name alone (e.g. harrisonai/coder-dev:base, which will always use the
#     most recent release), and
#   * by default/latest, which will always be the most recent release of 'base'.
